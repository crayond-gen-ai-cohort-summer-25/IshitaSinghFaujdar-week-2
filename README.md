Hi there,
My file structure is as follows:
1. app.py- main code
2. demo_video_task2.mkv - demo video
3. logs- logs for each run
4. documentation-
   1. learning- week's theoretical learning
   2. task- task documentation
5. bonus_task- for the week's bonus task all the necessary things are in this folder. There is not readme.md in this but the documentation folder has everything required.
